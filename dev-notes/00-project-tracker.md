# Project Tracker

**Version:** 0.4.1

**Current Phase:** Milestone 10 (Polish) — M9 complete
**Overall Progress:** 88% (M9 done; M10 + M11 outstanding)

## Overview

Tidy Resize Images is a WordPress plugin for keeping the Media Library lean.
It scans uploads (on arrival and retroactively in bulk) and applies three
classes of fix: oversized longest-edge dimensions, oversized file size, and
unsuitable file format. Originals are backed up to a Trash directory and can
be restored. Attachments can be marked "do not touch" so logos and brand
assets are never altered. Full WP-CLI surface mirrors the admin UI.

Built to fill the gap left by Imsanity, which handles dimensions well but
ignores file-size-only problems and offers no restore path.

## Active TODO Items

### M8 — done ✅ (split across two evenings, both 2026-05-04)

M8a (foundation + cheap wins, evening session 1):
- [x] Extract shared `Attachment_Processor::process( $id, $dry_run, $orig_metadata = null )` and rewire Upload_Handler + Bulk_Processor
- [x] Add `_tri_processing_log` meta writer (last 5 entries, newest first) inside Attachment_Processor
- [x] Media Library list-table column: "Tidy" — icons for protected / processed / has-backup / conversion-skipped
- [x] Row actions: Protect, Unprotect (AJAX-driven, nonce + capability checked)
- [x] Track auto-translated POT + per-locale `.po`/`.mo` files (8 locales)
- [x] Trash restore now clears `_tri_processed_at` + `_tri_conversion_skipped`; new "Restore & protect" button on the Trash page

M8b (rest of the Media Library surface, evening session 2):
- [x] Row action: Optimize Now — delegates to `Attachment_Processor::process( $id, false )`; ignores global dry-run; hidden on protected attachments
- [x] Row action: Restore Original — only when `_tri_backup` exists
- [x] Bulk actions: Protect, Unprotect (no bulk Restore — destructive-ops-deliberate; no bulk Optimize — Bulk page covers it)
- [x] Attachment edit-screen meta box: protected toggle + processing log preview
- [x] Grid-mode protection toggle via `attachment_fields_to_edit` (with hidden marker for unticked-checkbox detection)

### M9 — done ✅ (2026-05-05)

WP-CLI surface implemented as an autonomous sprint. Three command
namespaces — top-level, `trash`, and `settings` — wrap the existing
service classes; no behavioural changes. Read-only commands support
`--format=table|json|csv|yaml` (+ `count|ids` where applicable);
`process` defaults to mutating with `--dry-run` / `--no-dry-run`
overrides on top of the site setting. Settings keys accepted as
short form or full wp_options name; writes go through the existing
sanitisers. See CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` for the full surface.

### Up next (Milestone 10 — Polish + Milestone 11 — Derivative Thumbnail Rename)

M11 is crucial (every successful conversion silently creates orphan
derivatives without it) and likely sequences before the final M10
polish bits. Both blocks are listed below in the Milestones section.

---

## Milestones

### M1 — Scaffolding & Activation ✅
Bootstrap plugin so it can activate, deactivate, show in admin menu, and
warn on conflicts. No image work yet.

- [x] Plugin header + bootstrap (entry file in root namespace; classes namespaced)
- [x] Constants file (option keys, meta keys, defaults, MIME types, conflicting-plugins list)
- [x] phpcs.xml + first clean phpcs run
- [x] Admin menu (top-level "Tidy Images" entry, `dashicons-format-image`, position 80)
- [x] Conflict detection (function `Tidy_Resize_Images\get_active_conflicts()` + `Admin_Hooks::render_notices()` rendering — collapsed from the originally-planned `Conflict_Detector` class)
- [x] Deactivate Imsanity on dev site
- [x] `readme.txt`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE` in place

### M2 — Image Processor Core ✅
Pure service class. Takes a file path + a ruleset, returns a "plan" describing
what would change. No WP hooks, no DB, no I/O side effects beyond reading the
source file. Easy to call from WP-CLI for testing.

- [x] Capability detection (GD vs Imagick, AVIF/WebP/HEIC availability) — `Capabilities` class
- [x] `Image_Library` wrapper (WP_Image_Editor + raw GD/Imagick reach-through)
- [x] `Image_Processor::plan( $path, $rules ): array` — returns Plan with action/target/quality/max_edge/strip_exif/reason/source_meta
- [x] `Image_Processor::execute( $plan, $path, ?$tmp_path ): array` — returns Result with success/committed/output_path/output_meta/savings/error; temp-file output, never mutates the source
- [x] Format decision tree (Simple/Auto mode) with `tri_format_decision` filter
- [x] Failed-conversion memoisation: `Skip_Memo` class + `Image_Processor::settings_hash()`
- [x] Strip-EXIF support (Imagick `stripImage()` second pass; GD-encoded files are stripped natively)
- [x] WP-CLI smoke-test snippet at `dev-notes/smoke-tests/processor-roundtrip.php`

### M3 — Settings Page ✅
Tabbed admin page. Fully drives the processor's ruleset.

- [x] Tab: Limits (max edge, max file size; per-context overrides deferred per agreement)
- [x] Tab: Format — Simple/Auto mode (lossy + alpha targets, per-format quality, AVIF capability-gated)
- [x] Tab: Format — Expert mode placeholder ("Coming soon" callout)
- [x] Tab: Behaviour (dry-run, strip EXIF, backup originals, trash retention, MIME exclusions; search-replace scope deferred to M6 alongside the implementation)
- [x] Tab: Status (capability detection summary, attachment counts, settings-hash debug; counts placeholder note while no processing has run)
- [x] Settings-hash computation for memoisation invalidation (built in M2.5; surfaced on Status tab)
- [x] `Settings` class with sanitisation, lazy `register()` on admin_init
- [x] `Image_Processor::from_settings()` factory
- [x] `assets/admin/tri-admin.css` + `tri-admin.js` (hash-based tab nav), enqueued only on the settings page

### M4 — Trash Manager ✅
Backup originals to `wp-content/uploads/tri-trash/{year}/{month}/`, store
restore metadata in `_tri_backup` post meta, provide restore.

- [x] `Trash_Manager::backup( $attachment_id ): bool` (idempotent)
- [x] `Trash_Manager::restore( $attachment_id ): bool` (regenerates `_wp_attachment_metadata`)
- [x] `Trash_Manager::purge( $attachment_id ): bool` (idempotent)
- [x] `Trash_Manager::list_trashed()` and `count_trashed()` query helpers
- [x] Trash admin page under Tidy Images → Trash submenu, with per-row Restore + Purge actions (admin-post.php + per-attachment nonces) and warning rows when `filename_changed=true`
- [ ] Auto-purge cron (configurable retention) — deferred to M10 polish per dependency on the cron-scheduling pattern not yet in use

### M5 — Upload Handler ✅
Hook the WP upload pipeline so new uploads are processed at arrival.

**Lower-priority workflow** — operator preference is to skip upload-time
processing on their own sites and rely on the daily cron run instead
(see M7's scheduled cron variant). Build M5 cleanly per the plan but do
not gold-plate; it's the safety net, not the headline feature.

- [x] `big_image_size_threshold` — honours our `max_edge` when ours is the lower value
- [x] `wp_generate_attachment_metadata` — full backup → execute → swap → regenerate-intermediates pipeline
- [x] Trash_Manager::backup before any mutation (skipped if `backup_originals=false`)
- [x] Skip_Memo::record after a `result_larger_than_source` discard
- [x] `_tri_processed_at` meta written on commit; `filename_changed=true` set on backup record when MIME changes
- [x] Self-unhooks during regenerate-intermediates to avoid filter recursion
- [x] Trash_Manager::restore() fixed to use `wp_create_image_subsizes()` directly so it doesn't trigger Upload_Handler's filter on restored files

### M6 — DB Search & Replace ✅
Required before bulk processor can rename safely. Serialized-data-aware.
v1 scope: posts + postmeta (no options, no multisite).

- [x] `Search_Replace::rewrite( $old_url, $new_url, $scope, $dry_run ): Report`
- [x] Serialized-safe walker for postmeta (matches both raw and JSON-escaped URLs)
- [x] Dry-run report (paths, counts, sample rows)
- [x] `rewrite_attachment_rename( $id, $old_meta, $new_meta )` convenience for sub-size rename batching
- [x] Scope toggles in Behaviour tab (posts / postmeta) + `Settings::sr_scope()` helper
- [x] Trash_Manager::restore() integration for reverse rewrite (filename_changed-aware)
- [x] Our own `_tri_*` meta keys are skipped to avoid mutating backup state
- [x] `unserialize` uses `allowed_classes=false` to neutralise object-injection risk

### M7 — Bulk Processor ✅
Admin AJAX runner that processes existing attachments in batches.
**This is the primary workflow** — interactive bulk runs, scheduled cron
(below), and `wp tidy-images process --all` (M9) all share the runner.
Upload-time processing (M5) is a lower-priority safety net.

- [x] Scan: SQL query for image attachments, ID > cursor, not protected, not already-processed
- [x] `Bulk_Processor::run_batch( $cursor, $limit, $dry_run ): Result` — pure runner with bounded work; consumed by admin AJAX and the daily cron (and M9 WP-CLI)
- [x] Admin AJAX endpoints (`tri_bulk_count`, `tri_bulk_step`) with capability + nonce checks
- [x] Bulk admin page under Tidy Images → Bulk with start/stop buttons, progress bar, totals table, log table
- [x] JS driver loops AJAX calls, accumulates totals, appends colour-coded log rows, supports stop mid-run
- [x] Dry-run mode showing predicted actions without mutation
- [x] Pre-run warning banner about marking logos / brand assets as do-not-touch
- [x] Scheduled-cron variant: `wp_schedule_event` daily hook calling `run_batch` with `DEF_CRON_BATCH_SIZE=20`; activation/deactivation hooks register/unregister
- [x] WP-CLI smoke-test snippet `dev-notes/smoke-tests/bulk-runner.php`
- [ ] Cron-scheduling UI (interval/batch-size override) — deferred to M10 polish per agreement

### M8 — Media Library UI ✅
Surface protection, status, restore in the standard Media Library list
view, the modal grid edit form, and the classic attachment edit screen.

- [x] Shared `Attachment_Processor` extracted; Upload_Handler and Bulk_Processor rewired
- [x] `_tri_processing_log` meta writer inside Attachment_Processor (last 5 entries)
- [x] "Tidy" column (icons: protected / processed / has-backup / conversion-skipped)
- [x] Row actions: Protect / Unprotect / Optimize Now / Restore Original (AJAX, vanilla JS, no jQuery)
- [x] Bulk actions: Protect / Unprotect (no bulk Restore or Optimize — by design)
- [x] Attachment edit-screen meta box: protected toggle + processing log preview
- [x] Grid-mode protection toggle via `attachment_fields_to_edit`
- [x] Trash page: "Restore & protect" button alongside Restore + Purge
- [x] Translations: POT + 8 locales tracked in `languages/`

### M9 — WP-CLI ✅
Wrap M2–M8 functionality so the operator can run everything from the
CLI. The interactive Bulk page is the headline workflow; WP-CLI is for
automation / scripted use / SSH-only ops.

- [x] `wp tidy-images scan` — count_candidates + sample of the first N (`--limit`, `--format=table|json|csv|yaml|count|ids`)
- [x] `wp tidy-images process <id>... | --all` with `--dry-run` / `--no-dry-run`, `--limit`, `--batch-size`
- [x] `wp tidy-images protect <id...>` / `unprotect <id...>`
- [x] `wp tidy-images restore <id>`
- [x] `wp tidy-images trash list | purge` (`--all --yes` for batch purge)
- [x] `wp tidy-images settings get | set` (short or full key form; routes through `Settings::sanitize_*`)
- [x] `wp tidy-images caps` — detected GD/Imagick capabilities

### M10 — Polish
- [ ] Status tab: live counts and last-run summary
- [ ] Trash retention cron auto-purge
- [ ] uninstall.php — clean removal of options + meta (keep trash files; let user purge manually)
- [ ] Translation files scaffolding (build script for re-running the DeepL tool against current strings)
- [ ] Stale trash records: defensive cleanup on the Trash page. ~20 backup records on the dev site have `path`/`orig_path` strings missing the docroot prefix (`/web/...` instead of `/var/www/.../web/...`) — likely written when WP was returning shorter paths. They `restore_failed` cleanly today, but the operator can't recover from them. Two reasonable fixes: (a) detect and offer a one-click "purge stale record" button per row, (b) auto-heal by retrying with the docroot-prefixed path before declaring failure. Lean toward (a) — simpler and keeps the operator in control.
- [ ] DRY the four `now_formatted()` copies (Trash_Manager, Skip_Memo, etc. still hold private versions; functions-private.php has the canonical helper since 0.3.0)

### M11 — Derivative Thumbnail Rename

**Crucial, not nice-to-have.** Should likely ship before the final M10
polish round — every successful format conversion silently creates
technical debt without it.

When a parent file's extension changes (e.g. `foo.jpg` → `foo.webp`),
the old sized derivatives on disk become orphans:

- Content references (`foo-485x360.jpg`) still resolve — the old JPGs
  are still on disk — so nothing visibly breaks today.
- But `_wp_attachment_metadata` no longer tracks them, so Force
  Regenerate Thumbnails / `wp media regenerate` won't manage them.
- A subsequent regenerate produces a parallel `.webp` set alongside the
  orphan `.jpg` set — actively *polluting* the upload tree we're
  meant to be tidying.

**Logic** (slots into the existing convert flow in `Attachment_Processor`):

1. Snapshot the old `_wp_attachment_metadata['sizes']` array (and
   `original_image` if set) **before** converting the parent.
2. Convert parent — existing flow.
3. For each old size entry `[file, width, height, mime-type]`, ask
   `Image_Processor` to produce a `WxH` derivative from the **new**
   parent, encoded at the new target MIME. Output: `foo-WxH.<new-ext>`.
4. `Search_Replace` old derivative URL → new derivative URL across
   the configured scope (per-size, or batched).
5. `Trash_Manager::backup()` each old `.jpg` derivative. Honours
   `backup_originals` setting like the parent path.
6. Write the rebuilt `sizes` array to `_wp_attachment_metadata`.

**Key design points:**

- **Iterate the OLD metadata snapshot, not currently-registered sizes.**
  The whole point is themes that registered odd sizes (`696x461`,
  `534x462`) and are now gone. `wp_create_image_subsizes()` /
  `wp_generate_attachment_metadata()` would lose exactly the sizes
  that have content references.
- **No "is it smaller?" gate on derivatives.** That gate exists for the
  parent (recompress-fallback in 27f614d). Once the parent is renamed,
  the equivalent-named derivative *must* exist; always emit it.
- **Hard-cropped sizes:** old metadata records dimensions but not crop
  offset/focus. Resize from centre — same as WP's own regenerate. Docs
  note required.
- **Restore path:** the existing `Trash_Manager::restore()` does reverse
  search-replace and is `filename_changed`-aware for the parent. The
  backup record schema needs to grow a derivative set (or a separate
  per-derivative backup record per parent rename) so restore reverses
  the per-derivative trash + URL rewrites too.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Snapshot pre-convert sizes in `Attachment_Processor` (only when the planned action is `convert` and the target MIME differs from source)
- [ ] Per-size regenerate via `Image_Processor` (new method, or reuse `execute()` with an explicit-dimensions plan)
- [ ] Per-derivative `Search_Replace` rewrite
- [ ] Per-derivative trash backup; extend `_tri_backup` schema to carry a derivative list
- [ ] Restore path: reverse the per-derivative rewrites and restore each derivative file
- [ ] Bulk page log: one collapsed summary per row, e.g. `+9 derivatives renamed`
- [ ] WP-CLI dry-run output: preview the per-derivative changes
- [ ] Docs note on hard-cropped sizes resize-from-centre behaviour

## Technical Debt

_None yet. Track decisions here when we trade short-term implementation for follow-up work._

## Notes for Development

### Constraints

- **No `shell_exec`**, `exec`, `proc_open`, `system`, etc. PHP GD or Imagick extensions only.
- **No Composer.** Plugin must work from a clean checkout.
- **No `declare(strict_types=1)`.** Per house style.
- **Single-Entry Single-Exit functions.** Per house style.

### AVIF policy

- AVIF is opt-in per site. Default target is WebP.
- Detect support at runtime — `function_exists('imageavif')` for GD, `Imagick::queryFormats()` for Imagick.
- If operator selects AVIF target but capability missing, fall back to WebP and surface a notice.
- AVIF encode is 5–10× slower than WebP. Acceptable for bulk runs; warn for upload-time use.

### Conflict detector — known image plugins to flag

Show admin notice if any of these are active alongside ours:
- Imsanity (`imsanity/imsanity.php`)
- EWWW Image Optimizer (`ewww-image-optimizer/ewww-image-optimizer.php`)
- ShortPixel Image Optimizer (`shortpixel-image-optimiser/wp-shortpixel.php`)
- Smush (`wp-smushit/wp-smush.php`)
- Optimole (`optimole-wp/optimole-wp.php`)
- reSmush.it (`resmushit-image-optimizer/resmushit.php`)
- TinyPNG / Compress JPEG & PNG (`tiny-compress-images/tiny-compress-images.php`)
- Converter for Media (`webp-converter-for-media/webp-converter-for-media.php`)

We never deactivate them. Operator's choice — we warn and let them decide.

### Failed-conversion memoisation

When a conversion attempt produces a file *larger* than the source, we discard
the result and record:

- `_tri_conversion_skipped` meta on the attachment containing:
  - `reason` (string) — `result_larger_than_source`
  - `attempted_target` — e.g. `image/webp`
  - `attempted_at` — datetime
  - `settings_hash` — sha1 of the relevant subset of settings used

On subsequent processing runs:
- If `settings_hash` matches current settings → skip the attachment (we already know it won't help).
- If `settings_hash` differs → discard the marker, re-attempt.

Settings hash inputs: target format, quality knobs, strip-EXIF flag.
Inputs that don't affect output bytes (e.g. dry-run flag) are excluded.

### Per-attachment meta keys

| Key                       | Type     | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `_tri_protected`          | bool     | Do-not-touch flag                        |
| `_tri_processed_at`       | string   | Last touch (Y-m-d H:i:s T)               |
| `_tri_processing_log`     | array    | What was done, last N entries            |
| `_tri_backup`             | array    | `{path,url,mime,bytes,width,height,trashed_at}` for restore |
| `_tri_conversion_skipped` | array    | Failed-conversion memoisation (above)    |

### DB search-replace scope (default)

- `wp_posts.post_content` — raw string replace
- `wp_postmeta.meta_value` — serialized-safe walker
- `wp_options.option_value` — serialized-safe walker, scoped to allow-list of option names
- Multisite tables — out of scope for v1

Never touch:
- User-generated commentary in `wp_comments`
- Custom tables outside our scope
- Anything matching a configurable deny-list

### Dry-run discipline

Every destructive operation supports `--dry-run` (CLI) / dry-run setting (admin).
Dry-run must produce a report that exactly enumerates what would change, with no
side effects on disk or DB.

### Format decision logic

**Mode:** Simple / Auto only for v1. Expert mode (from→to mapping matrix) is
a UI placeholder marked "Coming soon".

**Operator inputs (Simple mode):**
- Lossy target: WebP @ quality (default 80) | AVIF @ quality (default 65, capability-gated)
- Alpha-preserving target: WebP @ quality (default 85) | AVIF @ quality | keep PNG
- JPEG recompress quality (in-place, default 82)
- Strip EXIF: yes/no

**Decision tree (default implementation):**

```
1. _tri_protected meta set?                → skip
2. MIME on never-touch list?               → skip
3. _tri_conversion_skipped with matching
   settings_hash?                          → skip
4. Source MIME determines branch:
     image/png    → has alpha? alpha-target : lossy-target
     image/jpeg   → lossy-target (convert if different MIME, else recompress)
     image/webp   → lossy-target (convert if different MIME, else recompress)
     image/heic   → lossy-target (convert, may also resize) — capability-gated
     image/gif    → static? lossy-target : skip (animated)
     image/svg+xml → skip
5. Apply max-edge resize if needed (always lossless transform)
6. Encode at chosen target/quality
7. If output_bytes >= input_bytes AND no dimension change:
     a. If source is a writable lossy format (JPEG / WebP) AND the
        plan was a `convert` (target ≠ source MIME), retry with
        `Image_Processor::recompress_plan()` — recompress in source
        format at jpeg_quality (JPEG) or lossy_quality (WebP).
     b. If retry also yields larger-than-source, OR no fallback was
        applicable (PNG/HEIC/GIF source, or primary was already a
        recompress) → discard, write skip-memo.
     c. Otherwise → commit the fallback result, backup original.
   else                                   → commit, backup original
```

**No pixel-noise heuristic.** Operator is responsible for marking visually
sensitive assets (logos, line art, screenshots) as "do not touch" before
running bulk operations. Bulk processor surfaces this warning prominently.

**Hookability:** The decision step is a filter so a future Expert mode (or
third-party plugin) can override:

```php
$decision = apply_filters(
    'tri_format_decision',
    $default_decision,  // computed by Image_Processor::default_decision()
    $source_path,
    $source_meta,       // mime, width, height, bytes, has_alpha, etc.
    $rules              // current ruleset
);
```

`$decision` shape:
```php
array(
    'action'      => 'convert' | 'recompress' | 'resize_only' | 'skip',
    'target_mime' => 'image/webp',
    'quality'     => 80,
    'max_edge'    => 2560,  // null = no resize
    'strip_exif'  => true,
    'reason'      => 'auto_alpha_target',  // for logging
)
```

### HEIC handling

- Capability-gated: only attempted if Imagick reports HEIC in `queryFormats()`.
  GD does not support HEIC reading on most builds.
- Treated as a lossy source — same path as JPEG: convert to lossy-target,
  apply same "if larger, skip with memoisation" rule.
- Note: WordPress core does not allow HEIC uploads by default. HEIC files
  arrive via other plugins or manual placement. We process whatever we find.

### Source file references

- WordPress big_image filter: `wp-admin/includes/image.php` `wp_create_image_subsizes()`
- Upload pipeline: `wp-admin/includes/file.php` `wp_handle_upload()`
- Imsanity reference (do not copy): `wp-content/plugins/imsanity/`
